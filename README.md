# Snap

**A better, simpler, yet powerful Git alternative** (built on Git)

Git is powerful, but let's be honest — it's confusing. Snap gives you the same power with commands that actually make sense.

The name evokes the idea of taking **snapshots**, being **quick/snappy**, and the satisfying **"snap into place"** feeling when things work smoothly.

## Why Snap?

- **No staging area** - the #1 confusion point in Git
- **Conversational commands** - reads like English
- **Smart defaults** - does the right thing 90% of the time
- **Time-based thinking** - "when" instead of just hashes
- **Combined operations** - one command for common workflows

## Implementation Status

Snap is currently under active development. Here's what works today:

| Command | Status | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `snap init` | ✅ Working | Initialize a new repository |
| `snap changes` | ✅ Working | Show uncommitted changes with colors |
| `snap save` | ✅ Working | Commit changes (with AI or custom message) |
| `snap sync` | ✅ Working | Smart push/pull with conflict detection |
| `snap undo` | 🚧 Planned | Undo last commit |
| `snap goto` | 🚧 Planned | Time travel through history |
| `snap branch` | 🚧 Planned | Create/switch branches |
| `snap fork` | 🚧 Planned | Clone repository |
| `snap merge` | 🚧 Planned | Merge branches |
| `snap stack` | 🚧 Planned | Visual commit history |
| `snap diff` | 🚧 Planned | Show file changes |
| `snap ignore` | 🚧 Planned | Add to .gitignore |

## Core Commands

### `snap init`
Initialize a new repository in the current directory.

```bash
snap init
```

**What it does:**
- Creates a new Git repository
- Checks if already initialized (prevents accidents)
- Shows helpful next steps

### `snap changes`
See what files have changed. Shows modified, added, and untracked files.

```bash
snap changes
```

### `snap save [message]`
Commit your changes. No staging area confusion, just save what you've changed.

```bash
snap save "Add user authentication"
snap save  # Interactive prompt if no message
```

### `snap undo`
Undo your last save. Like `git commit --amend` but clearer.

```bash
snap undo           # Undo last save (keeps changes)
snap undo --hard    # Completely remove last save
snap undo 3         # Go back 3 saves
```

### `snap goto <when>`
Time travel through your project history.

```bash
snap goto yesterday
snap goto "before refactor"
snap goto abc123    # Still supports hashes
```

### `snap branch <name>`
Create and switch to a branch. No checkout confusion.

```bash
snap branch feature-x    # Create and switch
snap branch              # Show all branches
snap branch -d old-name  # Delete a branch
```

### `snap sync`
Smart push/pull combined. Figures out what you need automatically.

```bash
snap sync        # Pull then push - sync everything
snap sync --from # Only pull changes from remote
```

**What it does:**
- Checks for uncommitted changes (prompts you to save first)
- Pulls latest changes from remote
- Detects and reports merge conflicts
- Pushes your commits to remote
- Automatically sets upstream branch on first push

### `snap fork <url>`
Clone a repository (because that's what it actually is).

```bash
snap fork https://github.com/user/repo
```

### `snap merge <branch>`
Merge branches. Auto-detects conflicts and opens a clean conflict resolver.

```bash
snap merge feature-x
```

### `snap stack`
Visual history. Shows your save history as a clean timeline.

```bash
snap stack
```

### `snap diff [file]`
See what changed. Kept simple.

```bash
snap diff           # All changes
snap diff README.md  # Specific file
```

### `snap ignore <pattern>`
Add patterns to your ignore file interactively.

```bash
snap ignore "*.log"
snap ignore node_modules
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Go** (1.24.1 or higher)
2. **Git** (Snap is built on top of Git)
3. **Ollama** with Phi-4 (optional - for AI-powered commit messages)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snap.git
cd snap
./install.sh

# Or build manually
go build -o snap
sudo mv snap /usr/local/bin/
```

### Setup Ollama (Optional - for AI commit messages)

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Download Phi-4 model
ollama pull phi4
```

## How It Works

Snap is a wrapper around Git that translates intuitive commands into Git operations. You get all the power of Git with none of the confusion.

Behind the scenes:
- `snap init` → `git init`
- `snap changes` → `git status --short`
- `snap save` → `git add -A && git commit`
- `snap undo` → `git reset` (soft/hard depending on flags)
- `snap goto` → `git checkout` with smart date/message parsing
- `snap sync` → `git pull && git push` (with conflict detection)

## Philosophy

Git's complexity comes from its history and Unix philosophy. Snap reimagines version control for modern developers:

1. **No staging area** - You edit files, you save files. Simple.
2. **Human language** - Commands that read like sentences
3. **Smart automation** - The tool should work for you, not the other way around
4. **Visual clarity** - Clean, readable output always
5. **Safety first** - Hard to accidentally destroy work

## Coming from Git?

| Git Command | Snap Equivalent |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `git init` | `snap init` |
| `git status` | `snap changes` |
| `git add . && git commit -m "msg"` | `snap save "msg"` |
| `git commit --amend` | `snap undo` |
| `git checkout <ref>` | `snap goto <ref>` |
| `git checkout -b branch` | `snap branch branch` |
| `git pull && git push` | `snap sync` |
| `git clone` | `snap fork` |
| `git log` | `snap stack` |

## Examples

```bash
# Start a new project
snap init

# Make some changes, check what changed
snap changes

# Save the changes
snap save "Initial setup"

# Oops, forgot something
snap undo
# ... make changes ...
snap save "Initial setup (complete)"

# Create a new feature
snap branch user-login

# Save progress
snap save "Add login form"
snap save "Add validation"

# Sync your work with remote
snap sync

# Go back to main and merge
snap goto main
snap merge user-login

# Push everything
snap sync
```
